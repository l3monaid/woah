<h1> "My Life" Osama Bin Laden</h1>
<p> when i was young my daddy fiddled me, until i bled. 
When i complained the police told me to let bygons be bygons.
So i took it to my school....with an AR-15.
23 people did i kill,
my gun went pew pew pew. However the police came so i went boom boom boom. isis had got to me
my name....was Osama Bin Laden, and this is my story. here are my favourite things: </p>
<ul>
<li> terrorism </li>
<li> corn </li>
<li> vinnies sales </li>
<li> maccas frappes </li>
</ul>

<h2> EARLY LIFE </h2>
<p> i was born a young lassie, in medellin, colombia. My father was Pablo Escobar. He was a great father, however, when i reached a rip age of 12 he began the fiddling. I decided to change my gender, to a boy. He stopped fiddling me. One day a ISIS member came to do a speech at school, in an effort to recruit people.n i joined up as soon as they said they have choccy milk. I was shipped off to syria and began my terrorism career. </p>

<h3> MY TRAINING </h3>
<p> I began training when i was 16. I was a great shot with an ak-47, and ended up killing my first soldier 2 months later. We celebrated at the local Carls.Jr, i got a nice large burger, without any meat, because i was now practiced islam, and we dont eat meat on wednesdays. After a few months i was fully trained, and began fighting in the front lines.... thats when i lost Pardeep, he was my best friend. He grew up in India, however he saw a isis memeber kill his abusive dad, so he signed up. I continued fighting for a further 4 years before i decided to start my own terrorism cult. </p>

<h4> THE RISE OF AL-QEADA </h4>
<p> Al-Qeada is what i named it, after my childhood pet chief, which is russian for "al-qeada". Out first attack took place in 1989, where we killed Nelson Mandella. He went Boom..and died, it was pretty lit not gonna lie. However we wanted to do something bigger.... so we flew a plane into the world trade centre on september 11th, 2001. We got 3000 people dead. After that i went into hiding </p>

<h5> MY DEATH </h5>
<p> In april of 2011 my home was invaded by some westerners, and i died. So yeah, everyone celebrated my death. </p>
